# 🎬 Movie Network Explorer – SI 507 Final Project

This project explores how movies and TV shows are connected through shared directors and cast members using graph analysis. The program builds a network from IMDb Top 1000 titles and Netflix’s 2021 streaming catalog, then allows users to interact with that network through a command-line interface (CLI).
